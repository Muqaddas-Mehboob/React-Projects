### 🟡 What you can do next:
- Add a screenshot to each project folder as `preview.png`, and link them in this README.
- Add `README.md` inside each individual project to explain that project briefly (want help with that too? I can create a template).
- Add hosted links (e.g., from Netlify/Vercel) if you deploy them later.

Would you like me to generate one short `README.md` for one of the folders too (like your `weatherApp`)?
